# JuRe
JuRe Just Resizes! Choose a folder of images, and choose folder for the resized images to get dumped into.

# TODO
- Verify folders exist before processing
- Validate percentage entry text
- Currently doesn't behave correctly if resizing more than once per run
- Progress bar needs to be brought into main view class
- UI prettification, as much as tkinter allows...
- Consistenly create and use getters/setters for things that need to be get/set
- Persistent settings
- UI feedback where source and destination folder are set to
- Figure out which Pillow resizing algorithm is best (currently nearest neighbor)
- Long term: create image viewer/chooser UI for flagging images for resizing
